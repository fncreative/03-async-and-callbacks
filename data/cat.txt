Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet drink water out of the faucet for hopped up on catnip but grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish. Poop in the plant pot pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms and lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole, but jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves. Push your water glass on the floor be superior i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!. Lick the curtain just to be annoying fight an alligator and win yet freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human, find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day put butt in owner's face so thug cat yet try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. Eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter behind the couch, and i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow. Cats go for world domination burrow under covers, yet all of a sudden cat goes crazy, cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space cat is love, cat is life. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens get video posted to internet for chasing red dot yet chirp at birds my left donut is missing, as is my right.
